# Show-Tetrahedral-Surface

This algorithm visualizes the surface of a tetrahedral mesh in the form of a triangle mesh in Unity. The tetrahedral mesh was generated from  a .stl model of a sphere with radius one, and passed in as a geometry model into Matlabâ€™s function generateMesh().
By adjusting the parameters of the function to give a min-edge length of 0.1, we are given a tetrahedralized mesh of the sphere with 70 nodes and 198 tetrahedrons, organized as matrices in the 2 text files sphere_nodes.txt and sphere_elements.txt.
